                We are human fondation who help poor childrens around the world.
                We have been involved in humanitarian work since 1997. <br> We started as a local organization to help
                vulnerable families, the most abandoned children in orphanages.
                We believe that the greatest human duty is to care for our loved ones. How can we prove this to
                ourselves better than taking care of our children? So, be human, be good person, help and donate!<br>
                <br>
                Your donations help us help others. Net proceeds from the sale of your donated items help support our
                job training and education programs, offered at no cost to people in the community.
                We accept almost anything you can think of donating, from clothing and furniture to small appliances and
                toys. Items donated in good working condition will be thoroughly evaluated, and any existing data will
                be erased using certified technology tools. Items that can't be sold will be recycled in accordance with
                E-Cycle Washington's guidelines, which ensure that toxic materials stay out of our landfills.
